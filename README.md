# Mancala

## Overview

Mancala is a two player board game, dating back as far as Ancient Egypt, in which players use turn-based strategy to capture all of the stones of their opponent. This program takes the age-old game into the digital world, giving players the full functionality of the physical game, with a modern twist on the gameboard aesthetics.
